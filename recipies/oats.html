    <h4>These hearty steel-cut oats in the crockpot are so easy. I just can't get up in the morning to make breakfast for my husband before he leaves for work, so I put this in the slow cooker the night before, and when he wakes up, breakfast is served!</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup steel-cut oats</li>
        <li>1 cup peeled and chopped apple</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Combine water, steel-cut oats, apple, raisins, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in a slow cooker; stir until well combined and sugar is dissolved. Cover and cook on Low until oats are tender and creamy, 6 to 7 hours. For a softer texture, cook for 8 hours.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <span>Make sure you use steel-cut oats (not rolled oats!) or this will be a mushy mess.

    If your slow cooker runs hot, cook on the Warm setting instead of Low.</span>
